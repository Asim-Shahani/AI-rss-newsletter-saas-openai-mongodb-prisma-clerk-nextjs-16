### Technical Features (The Smart Stuff)

#### Intelligent Cross-User Caching
The system uses a **3-hour cache window** (This can be customized) that benefits all users. When someone fetches a feed, the data is fresh for everyone for 3 hours. This means:
- Faster newsletter generation (no waiting for feed refreshes)
- Fewer API calls to RSS providers
- More reliable (no rate limiting issues)
- Cost-effective at scale

**Example:** If User A fetches TechCrunch at 10:00 AM, and User B wants to generate a newsletter at 10:30 AM using TechCrunch, the system uses the cached articles from User A's fetch. Smart, right?

#### Article Deduplication
Articles are stored once, even if they appear in multiple feeds. Each article has a unique identifier (GUID) that prevents duplicates:
- Same article in multiple feeds = stored once
- Saves database storage (~50% reduction)
- Tracks which feeds reference each article
- Identifies trending topics (articles in many feeds)

#### Real-Time Streaming with Vercel AI SDK
Newsletter generation streams in real-time using the **Vercel AI SDK** for a seamless user experience:
- **Progressive Generation**: See your newsletter being created live as the AI writes
- **Clean Architecture**: No custom streaming code—AI SDK handles everything
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for feed refresh and article analysis
- **Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with Zod schema validation
- **Simple & Maintainable**: Built with standard patterns that any developer can understand

The AI SDK's `streamObject` and `useObject` hooks make streaming incredibly simple—no manual SSE parsing or complex state management required.

#### Tech Stack Highlights

- **Next.js 16** with App Router and React 19
- **Turbopack** for lightning-fast development
- **TypeScript** end-to-end with strict mode
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for modern styling
- **Clerk** for authentication, billing, and user management

  - Zero custom streaming code—clean and simple
- **RSS Parser** for reliable feed fetching
- **Biome** for code quality and formatting
- **React 19** with Server Components for optimal performance

## How It Works

### The Newsletter Generation Flow

```mermaid
graph TB
    User[Newsletter Creator] --> Dashboard[Dashboard]
    Dashboard --> Generate[Generate Newsletter]
    
    Generate --> Cache{Fetched Within 3 Hours?}
    Cache -->|Yes| Articles[Retrieve Articles]

    style AI fill:#10a37f
    style DB fill:#00ed64
    style User fill:#6366f1
    style Stream fill:#f59e0b
```

### The Smart Caching System

Here's how the cross-user caching saves time and resources:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U1 as User A
    participant U2 as User B
    participant System
    participant DB as Database
    participant RSS as RSS Feed
    
    Note over U1,RSS: 10:00 AM - User A generates newsletter
    U1->>System: Generate newsletter with TechCrunch
    System->>DB: Check when TechCrunch last fetched (any user)
    DB-->>System: Never fetched
    System->>RSS: Fetch TechCrunch RSS feed
    RSS-->>System: 50 articles
    System->>DB: Store articles + lastFetched = 10:00 AM
    System->>U1: Generate & stream newsletter
    
    Note over U1,RSS: 10:30 AM - User B generates newsletter
    U2->>System: Generate newsletter with TechCrunch
    System->>DB: Check when TechCrunch last fetched (any user)
    DB-->>System: Last fetched 30 min ago by User A
    Note over System: Within 3-hour cache window ✓
    System->>DB: Use existing articles (no RSS fetch!)
    System->>U2: Generate & stream newsletter
    
    Note over System: User B benefits from User A's fetch!
```

### Article Deduplication Strategy

The system prevents storing duplicate articles across feeds:

```mermaid
graph LR
    FA[Feed A] --> System[Deduplication System]
    FB[Feed B] --> System
    FC[Feed C] --> System
    
    System --> DB{Article Exists?}
    DB -->|No| Create[Create New]
    DB -->|Yes| Update[Update sourceFeedIds]
    
    Create --> Final[Database]
    Update --> Final
    
    style System fill:#3b82f6
    style Final fill:#10b981
```

**Result:** The article "GPT-5 Announced" appears in 3 feeds but is stored once, with `sourceFeedIds: [Feed A, Feed B, Feed C]`. This not only saves storage but also helps identify trending topics!

**Performance & Complexity:**
- ⚡ **Lookup**: O(1) via unique index on `guid`
- 💾 **Storage Savings**: ~40-50% reduction for overlapping feeds
- 📊 **Trending Detection**: Articles in multiple feeds = high importance
- ⚠️ **Note**: The deduplication happens at insert time using MongoDB's `upsert` operation, making it very efficient

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm, yarn, or pnpm
- Accounts: Clerk, MongoDB Atlas, OpenAI

### 1) Clone & Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-newsletter-saas-nextjs-16-mongodb-clerk

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
# or
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 2) Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the **project root**:

> 💡 **Tip:** Copy the provided `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env.local`, then fill in your actual values:
> ```bash
> cp .env.example .env.local
> ```

```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here

# MongoDB Database
DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/newsletter-db?retryWrites=true&w=majority

# Prisma Accelerate (Optional - for edge optimization)
# DATABASE_URL=prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=your_api_key

# OpenAI API
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Important Security Notes:**

- **NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY**: Safe to expose in client code (starts with `pk_test_` or `pk_live_`)
- **CLERK_SECRET_KEY**: Keep secret! Never commit to git (starts with `sk_test_` or `sk_live_`)
- **DATABASE_URL**: Your MongoDB connection string with credentials
- **OPENAI_API_KEY**: Keep secret! Never expose publicly (starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`)

> **Tip:** The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix makes variables accessible in client-side code. Only use this prefix for non-sensitive data like publishable keys and project IDs.

### 3) Configure Clerk

1. Create a new application at [Clerk](https://go.clerk.com/sonny)
2. Choose authentication methods:
   - **Email & Password** (recommended for simplicity)
   - **Google OAuth** (recommended for user convenience)
   - **GitHub OAuth** (optional, great for developer audiences)
3. Copy your API keys:
   - Navigate to **API Keys** in Clerk Dashboard
   - Copy **Publishable Key** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - Copy **Secret Key** → `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
4. Configure allowed origins:
   - Go to **Domains** in Clerk Dashboard
   - Add `http://localhost:3000` for development
   - Add your production domain when deploying
5. Set up pricing plans:
   - Navigate to **Billing** → **Pricing Plans**
   - Create a **Starter** plan (free or low-cost)
   - Create a **Pro** plan with extended features
   - Set plan limits (RSS feeds, newsletter history, etc.)

### 4) Configure MongoDB Atlas & Prisma

#### Create MongoDB Database

1. Sign up at [MongoDB Atlas](https://fandf.co/48QTwh2)
2. Create a new **FREE** M0 cluster (512MB, perfect for getting started)
3. Choose a cloud provider and region (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure)
4. Create a database user:
   - Username: `newsletter-admin` (or your choice)
   - Password: Generate a secure password
   - **Save this password!** You'll need it for the connection string
5. Whitelist IP addresses:
   - Add `0.0.0.0/0` to allow connections from anywhere (for development)
   - For production, restrict to specific IPs
6. Get your connection string:
   - Click **Connect** → **Connect your application**
   - Copy the connection string
   - Replace `<password>` with your database user password
   - Replace `myFirstDatabase` with your database name (e.g., `newsletter-db`)

#### Initialize Prisma

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
pnpm prisma:generate
# or
npm run prisma:generate

# Push database schema to MongoDB
pnpm prisma:push
# or
npm run prisma:push

# (Optional) Open Prisma Studio to view your database
pnpm prisma:studio
# or
npm run prisma:studio
```

**What these commands do:**
- `prisma:generate` - Creates TypeScript types from your Prisma schema
- `prisma:push` - Syncs your schema with MongoDB (creates collections and indexes)
- `prisma:studio` - Opens a visual database browser at `http://localhost:5555`

### 5) Configure OpenAI

1. Create an OpenAI account at [OpenAI](https://openai.com)
2. Add billing information:
   - Go to **Billing** → **Payment methods**
   - Add a credit card (required for API access)
   - Set a monthly budget limit (recommended: $20-50 for development)
3. Create an API key:
   - Navigate to [API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Click **Create new secret key**
   - Name it (e.g., "Newsletter Generator Dev")
   - **Copy the key immediately** (you can't see it again!)
   - Add to `.env.local` as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. Choose your AI model:
   - By default, this app uses **GPT-4o** (`gpt-4o` model)
   - **The model is fully customizable** - edit `actions/generate-newsletter.ts` line 106 to use:
     - `gpt-4o` (default) - Best quality, higher cost
     - `gpt-4o-mini` - Faster and cheaper alternative
     - `gpt-4-turbo` - Previous generation
     - `gpt-3.5-turbo` - Most cost-effective option
   - Check your account has access to your chosen model in the API settings

**Cost Considerations:**
- Newsletter generation typically costs $0.01-0.05 per newsletter with GPT-4o (depending on length)
- GPT-4o-mini reduces costs by ~90% ($0.001-0.005 per newsletter)
- 1,000 newsletters ≈ $10-50 (GPT-4o) or $1-5 (GPT-4o-mini)
- Monitor usage in OpenAI Dashboard → Usage

### 6) Run the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

**First Time Setup:**
1. Sign up for an account (creates user in MongoDB automatically)
2. Go to Settings to configure your newsletter preferences
3. Add RSS feeds (try TechCrunch: `https://techcrunch.com/feed/`)
4. Generate your first newsletter!

## Database Schema Overview

The app uses **4 main models** in MongoDB:

### User
Stores minimal user info (Clerk handles authentication):
- `clerkUserId` - Links to Clerk user
- Relationships: RSS feeds, newsletters, settings

### UserSettings
Customization preferences for newsletter generation:
- Newsletter name, description, target audience
- Brand voice, company info, industry
- Default tone and styling preferences

### RssFeed
RSS feed subscriptions:
- Feed URL, title, description
- `lastFetched` timestamp (used for caching)
- Relationships: articles

### RssArticle
Individual articles with deduplication:
- `guid` - **Unique identifier** (prevents duplicates)
- `sourceFeedIds` - Array of all feeds referencing this article
- Title, content, summary, publication date
- Categories, author, images

### Newsletter
Generated newsletters (Pro users only):
- 5 suggested titles, 5 subject lines
- Newsletter body (markdown formatted)
- Top 5 announcements
- Date range and feeds used
- User input/context

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **MongoDB** for flexible schema and easy scaling
- **GUID-based deduplication** to prevent storing duplicate articles
- **Indexes on common queries** (`feedId + pubDate`, `userId + createdAt`)
- **Cascade deletes** to maintain data integrity

## Deployment to Vercel

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Development Issues

**Problem:** Port 3000 is already in use
```bash
# Solution: Use a different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

**Problem:** TypeScript errors after schema changes
```bash
# Solution: Regenerate Prisma Client
npm run prisma:generate
```

**Problem:** Build fails with "Module not found"
```bash
# Solution: Clean install dependencies
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
npm run build
```

**Problem:** Environment variables not loading
- Ensure `.env.local` exists in project root (not in subdirectories)
- Restart dev server after changing environment variables
- Check for typos in variable names (case-sensitive!)

### Database Issues

**Problem:** "Can't reach database server"
- Check MongoDB Atlas cluster is running (not paused)
- Verify IP whitelist includes `0.0.0.0/0` or your IP
- Test connection string in MongoDB Compass
- Check for special characters in password (may need URL encoding)

**Problem:** Prisma schema out of sync
```bash
# Solution: Push schema to database
npm run prisma:push

# Or reset database (⚠️ deletes all data)
npx prisma db push --force-reset
```

**Problem:** "Authentication failed" on connection
- Verify database username and password
- Check DATABASE_URL format: `mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.net/dbname`
- Special characters in password need URL encoding (`@` → `%40`, `#` → `%23`)

### Clerk Authentication Issues

**Problem:** "Invalid publishable key"
- Verify you're using the correct environment key (test vs. production)
- Check key is set in `.env.local` with correct variable name
- Restart dev server after adding keys

**Problem:** Redirect loops or "not authorized"
- Clear browser cookies and cache
- Check Clerk Dashboard → Settings → Paths match your routes
- Verify `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` is correct

**Problem:** "User not found in database" after sign in
- The app creates users automatically on first sign in
- Check MongoDB to verify user was created
- Look for errors in console during sign-in flow

### RSS Feed Issues

**Problem:** "Invalid RSS feed URL"
- Verify URL returns valid RSS/Atom XML
- Test URL in RSS feed validator: [W3C Feed Validator](https://validator.w3.org/feed/)
- Some sites block automated requests (check User-Agent)

**Problem:** Feed won't refresh
- Check `lastFetched` timestamp in database
- Feeds only refresh if older than 3 hours (by design)
- For testing, manually update `lastFetched` to an old date

**Problem:** No articles after adding feed
- Some feeds don't include full content (only summaries)
- Check feed URL actually has articles
- Verify date range includes article publication dates

### OpenAI Generation Issues

**Problem:** "OpenAI API key invalid"
- Verify key starts with `sk-proj-` or `sk-`
- Check you copied the entire key (they're long!)
- Ensure you have billing set up in OpenAI Dashboard

**Problem:** Rate limit errors
- OpenAI has rate limits based on your account tier
- New accounts: 3 requests/min, 200 requests/day
- Upgrade tier or wait for rate limit to reset
- Check usage in OpenAI Dashboard

**Problem:** Newsletter generation fails or returns gibberish
- Verify you're using `gpt-4o` model (not `gpt-3.5-turbo`)
- Check you have GPT-4 access in your OpenAI account
- Ensure articles were fetched correctly (check database)

**Problem:** Streaming doesn't work
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the AI SDK hook is properly initialized
- Ensure network connectivity to the API endpoint
- Disable browser extensions that might block streaming

### Deployment Issues

**Problem:** Build succeeds locally but fails on Vercel
- Check Node.js version matches (Vercel uses Node 18 by default)
- Verify all dependencies are in `package.json` (not just `devDependencies`)
- Check for environment-specific code that breaks in production

**Problem:** Environment variables not working in production
- Re-check all variables are added in Vercel Dashboard
- Make sure no trailing spaces in variable values
- Redeploy after adding/updating environment variables

**Problem:** "Internal Server Error" in production
- Check Vercel Function Logs for detailed errors
- Verify DATABASE_URL is production cluster (not localhost)
- Check OpenAI API key is valid for production use

### Important Concepts

**RSS Feed Caching**: Feeds are only refreshed if last fetched > 3 hours ago (by ANY user)

**Article Deduplication**: Articles identified by GUID, stored once, referenced by multiple feeds

**Streaming Generation**: Newsletter content streams in real-time using the Vercel AI SDK

**Pro Features**: Newsletter history and unlimited feeds require Pro plan (managed by Clerk)
